# AI-Powered Virtual Try-On for Clothing 👖👗🤖

---

## Overview 🚀👗👕
This project is an **AI-driven virtual try-on system** that allows users to visualize how different garments look on them without physically trying them on. By combining **object detection**, **body pose estimation**, and **image overlay**, it provides a **realistic virtual fitting experience**. This system is designed to integrate seamlessly with e-commerce platforms to enhance **online shopping**.

---

## Features 🌟🛠️
- 🔹 **Real-Time Virtual Try-On**: Try various garments such as jackets, shirts, and dresses in real time.
- 🔹 **Body Pose Estimation**: Uses MediaPipe for precise garment alignment based on the user's posture.
- 🔹 **Personalized Fit Recommendations**: Offers size suggestions tailored to user body measurements.
- 🔹 **Distance Estimation and Size Adjustments**: Ensures realistic garment overlay by adjusting for user distance.
- 🔹 **E-Commerce Integration**: Provides purchasing options directly within the application.

---

## Prerequisites 📊💻
Ensure the following are installed before running the project:

- 🔹 **Python**: Version 3.7+

### Required Packages 🔧
Install the necessary Python packages by running:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python mediapipe flask torch torchvision
```
