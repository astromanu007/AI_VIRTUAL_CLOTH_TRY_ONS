### AI-Powered Virtual Try-On for Clothing 👚👖🤖
##Overview 🚀👗👕
This project is an AI-driven virtual try-on system that enables users to visualize how different garments look on them without physically trying them on. Using a combination of object detection, body pose estimation, and image overlay, this project provides a realistic virtual fitting experience that can be integrated with e-commerce platforms for online shopping.

##Features ✨🛠️
Real-time virtual try-on for various garments 🧥👗
Body pose estimation using MediaPipe for accurate garment alignment 🧍‍♂️💃
Personalized fit recommendations based on user body measurements 📏👕
Distance estimation and size adjustments for realistic garment overlay 📐📸
Integration with e-commerce platforms for easy purchasing options 🛒💳
Prerequisites 📋💻
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

##🐍 Python 3.7+
##Required Packages:
Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python mediapipe flask torch torchvision
How to Run 🏃‍♂️💻
Step 1: Clone or Download the Project 📁📥
Download or clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Virtual-Try-On
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd AI-Virtual-Try-On
Step 2: Set Up the Model Files 📂🔗
This project requires several pre-trained models to run various features:

SMPL-X Model: For accurate 3D body modeling.
Pix2Pix (cGAN) Model: For garment overlay simulation.
Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN): For personalized fit recommendations.
Ensure these files are stored in the models/ directory as specified in the project structure.

Step 3: Running the Application 🖥️🚀
To start the virtual try-on system, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser to access the application.

## Command-Line Arguments
--model: Path to the trained garment overlay model.
--prototxt: Path to the Caffe deploy prototxt file (for object detection).
--confidence: Minimum probability to filter weak detections (default is 0.5).

## Using the Application 🎥🖱️
Webcam Access: If enabled, the app can use your webcam to capture real-time images.
Image Uploads: Upload images of both the user (model) and the garment to be tried on.

## Key Interactions:
Click "Try On" to start the virtual try-on.
Press q to quit the application if using live detection.

## Project Details 📊📈

## Technology Stack Used 💻🔧
Pix2Pix (cGAN) for garment overlay simulation 👗📦
MediaPipe Pose for human pose estimation 🧍‍♀️🤸‍♂️
SMPL-X Model for realistic 3D body modeling 📏🧑‍🎤
OpenCV for image processing 📷🖼️
Flask for web application framework 🌐🖥️
PyTorch for machine learning tasks 🔥💻

## Main Functionalities of the Script:
Garment Overlay Simulation: Uses Pix2Pix (cGAN) to overlay garments onto the user's model image.
Pose Estimation: MediaPipe Pose identifies key body landmarks for accurate garment alignment.
Size Recommendation: Recommends the most suitable garment size based on user body measurements.
Real-Time Processing: Displays results in real time, allowing users to try different garments quickly.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️🔧
Model Files Missing: Ensure that the necessary model files are downloaded and located in the models/ directory.
Webcam Not Detected: Verify that your webcam is connected and accessible by your browser or device.
Dependency Issues: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to ensure all dependencies are installed.
Example Output 📸🖼️
Upon running the script, you will see:

The user's uploaded model image with the garment overlay applied.
Key landmarks on the body for alignment.
Size recommendations based on body measurements.

## Additional Notes 📝🔍
Performance: Real-time performance depends on your device’s computational power.
Future Enhancements: Plans include adding more robust body and garment segmentation for improved overlay accuracy and compatibility with additional clothing styles.
Focal Length Calibration: Modify the focal length in estimate_distance() for more accurate distance estimations, if necessary.
